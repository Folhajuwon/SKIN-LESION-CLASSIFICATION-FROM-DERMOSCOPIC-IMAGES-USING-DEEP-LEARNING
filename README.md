# SKIN-LESION-CLASSIFICATION-FROM-DERMOSCOPIC-IMAGES-USING-DEEP-LEARNING
Early detection of melanoma, a highly aggressive form of skin cancer, is crucial. Accurate classification is essential for treatment, as starting treatment early can significantly improve the chances of survival. This project presents a comprehensive analysis of three machine learning models applied to classify dermoscopic images of skin lesions: two (2) pre-trained (ResNet50 and BiT Transfer) and one (1) developed Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). This project utilized the ISIC (International Skin Imaging Collaboration) dataset, which contains a diverse collection of dermoscopic images containing skin lesions.
The modelâ€™s performance was evaluated based on a range of metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. My primary objective was to develop and compare models capable of accurately classifying these images as benign or malignant, enhancing melanoma detection accuracy and potentially reducing false negatives in clinical settings.  My analysis revealed that among the three models analyzed, ResNet50 demonstrated the highest overall performance in melanoma detection. Its high accuracy, precision, and recall rate suggest that it could be a valuable tool for assisting dermatologists in the early detection of melanoma.

Skin cancer, a  prevalent and potentially life-threatening disease characterized by the abnormal and uncontrolled growth of skin cells, is one of the most prevalent and potentially life-threatening diseases globally. According to Mahbod et al. (2019), statistics indicate that one in five individuals in the United States will develop some form of cancer in their lifetime. It is the most common type of cancer in the United States. There are three main types of skin cancer: basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and melanoma. Among these, melanoma is considered the most dangerous due to its ability to spread to other parts of the body if not detected early. As such early and accurate detection of melanoma is critical, as timely intervention can significantly improve the chances of patients surviving 
The implementation of deep learning algorithms to dermoscopic images offers significant potential in advancing skin cancer diagnosis. With the widespread availability of high-resolution cameras, lesions can be captured, and algorithms, such as CNN, can be applied to analyze these images, which will aid automated diagnostic systems. Several studies have explored various machine learning techniques, such as k-nearest neighbors, support vector machine, and random forest, for skin lesion classification.
