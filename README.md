# SKIN-LESION-CLASSIFICATION-FROM-DERMOSCOPIC-IMAGES-USING-DEEP-LEARNING
Skin cancer, a  prevalent and potentially life-threatening disease, characterized by the abnormal and uncontrolled growth of skin cells, is one of the most prevalent and potentially life-threatening diseases globally. According to Mahbod et al. (2019), statistics indicate that one in five individuals in the united states will develop some form of cancer in their lifetime it is the most common type of cancer in the United States. There are three main types of skin cancer which are, basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and melanoma. Among these, melanoma is considered the most dangerous due to its ability to spread to other parts of the body if not detected early. And as such early and accurate detection of melanoma is critical, as timely intervention can significantly improve the chances of patients surviving 
The implementation of deep learning algorithms to dermoscopic images offers a significant potential in advancing skin cancer diagnosis. With the widespread availability of high resolution camera, lesions can be captured and algorithms, such as CNN, can be applied to analyze these images which will aid automated diagnostic systems. Several studies have explored various machine learning techniques, such as k-nearest neighbors, support vector machine, random forest for skin lesion classification.
